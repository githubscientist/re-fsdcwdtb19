# React Application

## Folder Structure

- public
  - For static files like images, icons, etc.

  - main.jsx: entry point of the application.
  - index.css: global styles for the application or brand kit.
  - App.jsx: main component of the application.
  - App.css: styles for the main component.
- .gitignore: specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- eslint.config.js: configuration file for ESLint (a linting tool for JavaScript, which helps identify and fix problems in your code).
- index.html: the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- package.json: contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.

## package.json vs package-lock.json

- `package.json`: This file contains metadata about the project, including its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and other configurations. It is manually edited by developers to add or update dependencies and scripts.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated when you install or update dependencies. It locks the versions of the installed packages and their dependencies, ensuring that the same versions are used across different environments. It helps maintain consistency in the project by preventing unexpected changes in the dependency tree.
